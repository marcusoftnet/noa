# What?
A little ark of a web framework on the vast ScriptCs/C#-ocean (and a .net clone of the Koa Node framework)
# Why?
Because Koa is sooo sweet that I had to see if it was possible on the .NET stack
# How?
Since Script CS now https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/releases/tag/v0.10 supports both dynamic and async/await on the Mono framework
# When? 
Ouch ... Later? I'll have other things going on right now but my strategy is to port the test first and then see. 
# Who?
Right now @marcusoftnet but you are welcome to join.
